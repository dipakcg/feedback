## About dipakcg/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from 
[@markjaquith's feedback repo](https://github.com/markjaquith/feedback), originally commited by [@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

I'm very bad at e-mail (and only one person benefits from my answer there), and Twitter is sometimes too short for more technical/involved discussions.

That said, I can't answer everything, and this isn't a replacement for the [WordPress.org support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/).

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue][ask] on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can. Once I answer I'll probably close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

These don't have to be technical questions, either! Go ahead and ask anything. If I don't
feel comfortable answering, I won't — but there's no harm in trying.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues][answered]
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@dipakcg][twitter] on
Twitter.
